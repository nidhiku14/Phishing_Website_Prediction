This is my self made project to enhance my learning in Data Science by practical Examples
PREDICTING BEST ML MODEL FOR DETECTING PHISHING WEBSITES AND DATA VISUALIZATION
From the dataset , We have learnt that this is a supervised machine learning. This dataset uses a classification problem, it has input URL classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). The supervised machine learning models (classification) considered to train the dataset in this notebook are:

1. Decision Tree
2. LogisticRegression
3. RandomForestClassifiers
4. XGBoost
5. KNeighborsClassifier


At the end of this project we will conclude that  XG Boost is the best ML Model to be used for this dataset as it has 86.1% accuracy
